	 * So hello everyone, I am not here today, 3/22, I am instead on a Chinese Field Trip to New York,
	 * Good luck with the Demo today, you should be fine as the game as a whole works
	 * But for over the weekend you guys need to do a ton of work
	 * - STILL THE UI FOR COMPUTER GAMES AND SCORESCREEN DOESN'T WORK
	 * - DO LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE TILL THAT IS FIXED
	 * - SERIOUSLY WHY HAS THIS TAKEN WEEKS!
	 * 
	 * If once the Score Screen is done, you have difficulty initiallizing it from Main Game Screen/ itself thats fine, so if to test
	 * you need to just generate players/game to pass into the ScoreScreen thats fine
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Please Dont forget two things: TIES, and the difference between Round end and Game end
	 * For Human should go:
	 * MainMenu
	 * MainGameScreen
	 * ScoreScreen:Round
	 * MainGameScreen
	 * ScoreScreen:Round
	 * ...
	 * MainGameScreen
	 * ScoreScreen:Round
	 * ScoreScreen:Game
	 * MainMenu
	 * 
	 * Other things:
	 * - We need a third strategy, not essential but a better version can be done using Dijkstra's pathfinding algoritum
	 * 		-if no one knows how to do this I might attempt it over the weekend
	 * 
	 * Basically everything needs to be nearly done by Monday as it is due on Tues or Wed, we can't have half of everything
	 *  (aka the computer portion) still not functioning
